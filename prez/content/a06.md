# A06:2021<br>Vulnerable and Outdated Components

>Vulnerable Components are hard to test and assess risk for the OWASP group, and
is the only category to not have any Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs)
mapped to the included CWEs

## A06:2021<br>Vulnerable and Outdated Components 1/2<!-- .element: style="font-size:1.2em"-->

Start with this mindset - **"You are likely vulnerable"**:<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em"-->

- If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->
- If the software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This includes the OS, web/application server, database management system (DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments, and libraries<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->
- If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins related to the components you use<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->

## A06:2021<br>Vulnerable and Outdated Components 2/2<!-- .element: style="font-size:1.2em"-->

- If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task under change control, leaving organizations open to days or months of unnecessary exposure to fixed
vulnerabilities<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->
- If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched libraries<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->
- If you do not secure the components‚Äô configurations (see A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration)<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em"-->

- Typically scenario:
  - Components run with the same privileges as the application itself, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g., coding error) or intentional (e.g., a backdoor in a component)
