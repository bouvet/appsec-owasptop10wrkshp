# A04:2021<br>Insecure Design

>A new category for 2021 focuses on risks related to design and architectural
flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns, and
reference architectures.

## A04:2021<br>Insecure Design

>Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”<br><br>An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.

## Secure By Design 1/2

... an approach in development that helps to focus on making software as secure as possible already in the development process.

## Secure By Design 2/2

1. Minimise attack surface area
3. The principle of Least privilege
4. The principle of Defence in depth
5. Fail securely
6. Don’t trust services (always verify)
7. Separation of duties
8. Avoid security by obscurity

Note:

- Browse application, find "Green Smoothie"
- Try "Reset password". See secret question.
- Try "OWASP Juice Shop Holographic Sticker", "OWASP Juice Shop-CTF Velcro Patch" products
- Looks like it's startrek related.
- Google "Starfleet jim"
- "James T. Kirk" has a brother "George Samuel Kirk".
- Answer is "Samuel".

## Primary defenses

- Use threat modeling <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals to
help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Integrate security language and controls into user stories <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are
resistant to the threat model <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending
on the exposure and protection needs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
