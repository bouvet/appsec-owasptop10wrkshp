## ... 4 months earlier

- 24th Sept 2001 - Mark Curphey announced **OWASP** (WebAppSec mailing list)
- Goal: _make software security visible, so that developers everywhere
could make truly informed decisions about the risks and the solutions_
- Same goal as Bill Gate: _‚ÄúTrustworthy computing‚Äù_

Note:

- Mark worked as with software security in S.F. and moderated a mailing list
called WebAppSec
- Was convinced of the urgent need for a collaborative project to document
developers‚Äô experience with and knowledge of web application security
- Announced OWASP on the <code>WebAppSec</code> mailing list, registered the
domain OWASP.org, paid $20 for a hosting account, and I asked people to come help
- OWASP is a 501(c)3 non-profit US org - est. 2004
