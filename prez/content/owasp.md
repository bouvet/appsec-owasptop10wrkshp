## ... 4 months earlier

- 24th Sept 2001 - Mark Curphey announced **OWASP** (WebAppSec mailing list)
- The concern _...make software security visible, so that developers everywhere
could make truly informed decisions about the risks and the solutions_
- Bill Gates‚Äôs phrase could have applied to OWASP. The objective was the same,
_‚ÄúTrustworthy computing‚Äù_

- Mark worked as with software security in S.F. and moderated a mailing list
called WebAppSec
- Was convinced of the urgent need for a collaborative project to document
developers‚Äô experience with and knowledge of web application security
- Announced OWASP on the <code>WebAppSec</code> mailing list, registered the
domain OWASP.org, paid $20 for a hosting account, and I asked people to come help

### OWASP TOP 10

- OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
changing the software development culture into one that produces more secure code<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
