## ... 4 months earlier

- 24th Sept 2001 - Mark Curphey announced **OWASP** (WebAppSec mailing list)
- The concern _...make software security visible, so that developers everywhere could make truly informed decisions about the risks and the solutions_
- Bill Gates‚Äôs phrase could have applied to OWASP. The objective was the same, _‚ÄúTrustworthy computing‚Äù_

Note: 
- Mark worked as with software security in S.F. and moderated a mailing list called WebAppSec
- Was convinced of the urgent need for a collaborative project to document developers‚Äô experience with and knowledge of web application security
- Announced OWASP on the <code>WebAppSec</code> mailing list, registered the domain OWASP.org, paid $20 for a hosting account, and I asked people to come help
- OWASP is a 501(c)3 non-profit US org - est. 2004
