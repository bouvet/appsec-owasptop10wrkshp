## Memo: Trustworthy computing

>"To everyone at Microsoft and its subsidiaries. “Trustworthy computing,” is the highest priority for all the work we are doing.” - <br><small>B. Gates, 15th Jan 2002</small>

This memo launched the SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) initiative and generally shook up the industry."

## ... 4 months earlier

- 24th Sept 2001 - Mark Curphey announced **OWASP** (WebAppSec mailing list)
- The concern _...make software security visible, so that developers everywhere could make truly informed decisions about the risks and the solutions_
- Bill Gates’s phrase could have applied to OWASP. The objective was the same, _“Trustworthy computing”_

Note: 
- Mark worked as with software security in S.F. and moderated a mailing list called WebAppSec
- Was convinced of the urgent need for a collaborative project to document developers’ experience with and knowledge of web application security
- Announced OWASP on the <code>WebAppSec</code> mailing list, registered the domain OWASP.org, paid $20 for a hosting account, and I asked people to come help
