## CWE & MITRE

- CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration
- The MITRE Corporation (1958) is an American not-for-profit organization<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- MITRE supports various U.S. government agencies in the aviation, defense, healthcare, homeland security, and cybersecurity fields<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- MITRE began working on the issue of categorizing software weaknesses as early 1999
- First released 2006<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->

## CWE

- Common Weakness Enumeration is a community-developed list<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- Common software and hardware weakness types that have security ramifications
- “Weaknesses” are flaws, faults, bugs, or other errors in software or hardware implementation, code, design, or architecture that if left unaddressed could result in systems, networks, or hardware being vulnerable to attack<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->
- CWE List and associated classification taxonomy serve as a language that can be used to identify and describe these weaknesses in terms of CWEs<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.9em"-->

## CWE helps developers and security practitioners to

- Describe and discuss software and hardware weaknesses in a common language
- Check for weaknesses in existing software and hardware products
- Evaluate coverage of tools targeting these weaknesses
- Leverage a common baseline standard for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts
- Prevent software and hardware vulnerabilities prior to deployment
