# A02:2021<br>Cryptographic Failures

>Failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of sensitive data.<br><br>In previous lists this vulnerability was named _Sensitive Data Exposure_

Note:
- OWASP changed the name due to this is more a broad
symptom rather than a root cause. The focus should be on failures related to
cryptography (or lack thereof), which again could lead to exposure of
sensitive data.
